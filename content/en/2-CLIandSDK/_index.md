title: "Chapter 2: AWS CLI and AWS SDK"
---

Before this chapter, you have accessed and interacted with AWS via its web-based management console, which is a Graphical User Interface (GUI). However, to access and manage your resources programmatically, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) are two powerful and useful tools for these tasks.

# AWS CLI

AWS CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with AWS services using commands in your Terminal/Command Promt/PowerShell. With AWS CLI, you can perform various operations on your AWS resources at scales. You can also write scripts with multiple commands to automate repeated tasks, or a long sequence of tasks, which can be tedious and prone to error to do manually.

For more details, see the [CLI guides](./cli).

# AWS SDK

AWS SDKs are collections of software development tools, libraries and APIs that allow you to build applications that interact with AWS services. AWS SDKs are available in several programming languages, including Java, Python, .NET, etc. With AWS SDK, you can integrate your application with AWS services and perform operations on your resources programmatically.
